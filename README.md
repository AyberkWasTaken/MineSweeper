🚀 Minesweeper (OpenGL & C)

Classic Minesweeper game developed using the C programming language and GLUT/OpenGL libraries as part of my studies at Bilkent University, CTIS.
✨ Key Features

    Smart First Click: You will never hit a mine on your first move. The algorithm guarantees a "0-tile" (empty area) to give you a fair start.

    Recursive Reveal: Efficient flood-fill algorithm that automatically expands empty areas and their numbered boundaries.

    Dynamic Theme Support: Toggle between Dark and Light modes in real-time with a dedicated UI button.

    In-Game Timer: Precision tracking of your game duration to challenge your best times.

    Windows API Integration: The console window is hidden for a cleaner look, and game alerts use native Windows Message Boxes.

🛠️ Installation & Usage
